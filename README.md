// In order for the program to run, it is important to ensure that the file name is named same as the class name

// As shown in the program above, the file is called "HelloKings" and the class is also called "HelloKings"

// For successful compilation and running, ensure the file is saved with a .java extension

// This program can be run from the command line by first compiling it, using the javac fineName.java command to compile

// And then there is running the file using the commands java fineName (without including extension)
